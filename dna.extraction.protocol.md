# KUNHM SPRI Bead DNA Extraction Protocol
This is a modified version of this original protocol: <https://github.com/phyletica/lab-protocols/blob/master/extraction-spri.md>
### Reagents
- Proteinase K 20mg/mL (CAS 39450-01-6)
- Lysis buffer
- Elution buffer
- [Speedbeads](https://baddna.uga.edu/Protocols/Speedbead_Protocol_June2016.docx)
- 70% ETOH

### Equipment
- [Magnet Stand](https://www.shapeways.com/product/ZT777WRDC/new-and-improved-12-tube-mag-stand-v2?optionId=57997553)

### Procedure
#### 1) Lysis
1. Prepare lysis master mix containing 20 &micro;L proteinase K and 280 &micro;L lysis buffer solution per sample plus a little extra to account for pipetting error.
2. Add 300 &micro;L of lysis master mix to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing up to 20 mg of sample tissue (approximately the size of a grain of rice).
3. Incubate samples at 55 &deg;C for at least 4 hours or overnight, vortexing regularly.

#### 2) Isolation
1. Allow Speedbead solution to warm to room temperature (in darkness) and mix by gently inverting the solution. Mix until beads are no longer sticking to the bottom of the tube. Before using beads, allow any bubbles that have been introduced by mixing to escape from the solution.
2. Add 300 &micro;L of bead solution to tube containing lysis product (1:1 bead:lysis ratio).
3. Mix sample by flicking tube.
4. Briefly centrifuge to collect sample in bottom of tube.
5. Let sample sit for 5 minutes (in darkness).
6. Place sample on magnet for 5 minutes or until all beads have collected on magnet and solution is clear.
7. Remove and dispose of solution without disturbing the beads on the magnet.
8. Add 1 mL of 70% ETOH.
9. Let sit for 1 minute.
10. Remove and dispose of ethanol without disturbing the beads on the magnet.
11. Add 1 mL of 70% ETOH.
12. Let sit for 1 minute.
13. Remove and dispose of ethanol without disturbing the beads on the magnet.
14. Dry in block at 37 &deg;C for 5 minutes, do not over-dry or your beads will not re-suspend.
15. Remove and dispose of remaining ethanol with a fine pipette tip.
16. Add 200 &micro;L of elution buffer and flick tube to mix beads into solution until they are no longer sticking to side of tube.
17. Briefly centrifuge to collect solution in bottom of tube.
18. Let stand for 1 minute.
19. Place on magnet stand for 5 minutes.
20. Remove as much of solution as possible without disturbing beads and put into new labelled tube.

#### Comments
To increase yield it may be beneficial to increase the time sample is allowed to sit at step 18. Warming the sample during this step may also help.
